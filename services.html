            Need a website, but don't know where to start? Or maybe you
            have a design written down, or a designer has done one for you, but you need the code written.<br><br>
            GuRiut Development can take your ideas and make a functional website from them. This website was designed and
            created solely by GuRiut. Here, we prefer a plain design as it is more practical, easier on the eye and 
            conforms better to the WCAG standards for accessibility in web design - hence the large text (easier to read
            for people with low vision) and the high contrast between colours.
        </p>
        <p class="text center hide large" id="main_text">
            Already have a website, but it's older, or has a clunky interface, or is running slowly? Maybe you'd like to 
            add in a page or function, or update the colour scheme. GuRiut Development can do this for you with both a 
            website built from scratch, or a website build on a platfrom such as Wix or Wordpress.
        </p>
        <p class="text center hide large" id="front_text">
            If you are using a different service or API for your backend, or are using a website building platform that
            provides a backend (such as Wix) then GuRiut Development can do just the front end.
        </p>
        <p class="text center hide large" id="back_text">
            If you already have a front end designer who has coded your website for you, GuRiut Development can collaborate
            with them and produce a backend for your website.
