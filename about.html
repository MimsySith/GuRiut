                Hi! My name is Miriam Smith and I am the sole trader owner of GuRiut Development. I am based in the regional
                city of Sale in Central Gippsland, Victoria, Australia.
                <br><br>
                I have a passion for logic, mathematics, and problem solving. I was introduced to programming through QBASIC
                when I was around 7 years old, then went onto Visual Basic when I was around 10 (my father is a mechanical
                engineer so we always had computers around the place).
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, I was struck down by a severe, debilitating illness when I was 13 and didn't respond to
                treatment until I was 30. This left me with little formal education and no formal work experience.
                <br><br>
                But I have a brain and I like to use it. I did a vendor's certification in full stack web development in 
                2021-2022, and subsquently have enrolled in a Bachelors of Applied Information Technology, which I am due to
                complete in around 2026.
                <br><br>
                Above are some examples of projects I have done, or am doing. The two on the left are an app I am designing
                to help people with schizophrenia and other severe illnesses. It is currently written using Angular, but I would
                like to make it native to both iOS and Android eventually, using Swift and Java. The one on the right is a pairs 
                game I wrote, also using Angular.
                This website is written traditionally in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, with the backend chugging along in Python
                using Django.
